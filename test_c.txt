Input:

eveHeryllo_!body
3
3 4 0
2 6 6
11 11 15


Output:

Hello_everybody!


How does it work?

First, we input numOps, which is 3.
Than, we input the three operations, which give:

Heeveryllo_!body
Hello_every!body
Hello_everybody!


Each operation consists of i, j & k, which are described in the source file.
n is length of the string, here 16.

Constraints:
0 <= i <= j <= n - 1
0 <= k <= n - (j - i + 1)
